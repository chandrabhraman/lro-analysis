Attitude control analysis of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission can be performed for the provided mission data from LRO mission to see how the spacecraft is able to maintain its desired orientation in space.

Attitude control is the process by which the spacecraft's orientation is controlled and maintained. This is typically done using a combination of reaction wheels, magnetic torquers, and thrusters. The reaction wheels are used to control the spacecraft's angular momentum and keep it pointing in the desired direction, while the magnetic torquers and thrusters are used to make fine adjustments to the spacecraft's orientation. 

This notebook is an exploration of interesting attitude and control data shared by the mission.
